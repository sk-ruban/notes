## Trolley Problem
* AV dillema = Trolley Problem
* Mercedes promised prioritising driver safety but later retracted
* ::People show *utilitarian preference* but *avoid personal sacrifice*::
* _Germany_: No distinction based on personal features but can reduce no. of injuries

* _Judges_: Be impartial despite the tendency to avoid personal sacrifice

## Definitions
### AI 
Machine based architectures that support models of thinking etc.

*Intelligent agent:*
1. Appropriate choice wrt circumstance
2. Flexible to changing environment
3. Learns from experience
4. Appropriate choice wrt to limitations

*AI doesn’t have:*
1. Emotions 
2. Consciousness

::*ANI (Narrow)*:: ->  Address a specific problem (Chess)  *CURRENT*
::*AGI (General)*:: -> Many different problems (Like humans) *Don’t Exist Yet(?)*

::*Machine Learning*:: -> learn without explicit programming
::*Deep Learning*:: -> subset of Machine learning; math simulation of neural networks

*XAI* -> Explainable AI (to understand & manage)

## AI Capabilities: 
1. *Prediction* - content & collaborative filters (Netflix)
	* Machine learning can find non-obvious data; non-stereotypical.
	* ::XAI Laws -> AI must be explainable (EU GDPR & SG personal data protection)::
	* AI able to predict dementia by patient's drawing of a clock
	* Banking fraud by false positives
	* Insurance claims (AXA) from predictions of accidents and when to charge higher premiums
		
2. *Natural Language Processing* - understand human language with context
	* Gmail smart reply 
	* Journalism (Earning reports and Local news)
	* Customer service (Chatbots and Call centres)
	* Virtual Assistance (Alexa, Siri) -> GDPR investigation
		- Siri & Alexa has stopped; Google?
		
3. *Image Processing*
	* Social media for scraping data (Flickr) -> Used by police
	* Rejection from NZ online passport; discrimination of small asian eyes
	* ::Deepfakes -> Video manipulation::
	* *Deepfakes accountability Act*; ::irremovable digital watermark::
		* ::Cons: Doesn’t work against anonymous agents::
        * ::Pros: Legal tool to catch person::

4. *Robotics*
		* Perform physical tasks (not chatbots)
		* Robots with NLP & image recognition
		* ::Uncanny valley -> likeness to humans results in disgust::
		
## AV
* Autonomous Vehicles (Combination of 4)
* In US, most people don’t want to ride
* In SG, most students want to ride
