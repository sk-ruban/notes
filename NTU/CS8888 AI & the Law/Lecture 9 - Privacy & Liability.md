# Lecture 9 - Privacy & Liability
25 Oct 2019

## Privacy
### PDPA
*  Victim makes complaint to PDPC
	* PDPC contacts org
	* Can fine up to 1M
	* Direct offender to take action (Training)
	* Warning
* Organisation covers natural persons, companies, associations regardless of birth location or office
* Need to comply with the collection, use & disclosure of data in SG
* ::FB required to comply::

### Personal Data
* Personal, Unique identifiers (NRIC, Facial image, voice etc.)
* Data about an individual: About Health, Education, Employment & activities such as spending
* ::Data + Unique Identifier = Personal Data:: 
* Online activity on FB is Personal Data
	
### Consent
* Organisation needs to notify of reasonable and specific purpose
* Need to Opt-in
* Org shall only require  what is reasonable to provide service (Like GDPR)
* Cannot obtain consent from misleading practices
* ::Not reasonable for gym to disclose data to Lululemon::

### Fining FB
* ::Yes if user did not give valid consent to FB to use data for personalised ads because its beyond what is reasonable::
* ::No if its reasonable to provide service::
* ::GDPR vs PDPA comparison:: PAGE 95

## Autonomous Vehicles (AVs)
### Purpose of AVs
* ::Improve safety:: & increase mobility
* Not justifiable unless it produces a diminution in harm
* Worldwide fatalities: 1.35M; 1 every 24 seconds
* SG fatalities: 124
* Human error is the reason for 94% of accidents
* ::Increase productivity, Reduce Emissions, Smooth Traffic flow, Reduce need for private car ownership / lesser parking::
* ::Reduces Joy of driving (flow), lost privacy, loss of driver jobs, fear::

### SAE
* SAE0: Human driver handles + blind spot monitoring warning
* SAE1: System handles 1 major function (cruise control & lane centering)
* SAE2: Sys handles >= 2 functions; human monitors
* SAE3: System drives; human controls when requested
* SAE4: System drives but only pre-mapped roads
* SAE5: System drives under all condition

* ::2-3: Quick handoff makes it more unsafe::
* Waymo & Google want to bypass 2 & 3
* Germany say no abrupt handover

### Uber Case
* Pedestrian jaywalking
* Family Lawsuit settled
* She/Uber may be partly liable as she breached a duty to be vigilant 
* Design Defect
	* No infrared detector that might have detected heat from pedestrian 
	* Some AVs have more LIDAR sensors than Uber
* Information Defect
	* No eye tracking to warn safety driver

### Tort Law
* ::A wrongful act leading to legal liability::
* Monetary damages payed to P
* ::Purpose::: 
	* Resolve disputes peacefully and fairly
	* Reduce accident by incentivising safety
	* Shift burden to party at fault or better suited to bear it
1. ::Tort of negligence::
	* Conduct falls below a standard of reasonableness
	* Requires ::fault - failure to act in accordance to duty::
2. ::Strict liability::
	* Liability without fault *Easier for plaintiff to win*
	* eg. Ultra-hazardous activity; keeping vicious animals
	* Manufacturer and designer liable

* Legally recognised duty to act as a reasonably prudent person
* Causation of:
	* ::Necessary:: cause: Harm wouldn’t have occured ::but for:: the Driver’s act
	* ::Proximate:: cause: Reasonable ::foreseeability:: of harm 
* Actual Harm

### Res Ipsa Loquitur
* Occurrence of accident is evidence of negligence *without proof of defect*
* ::For negligence (Surgeon scalpel) + products (CC explosion)::

* ::Useful for Level 4-5 AVs::
* ::Too complex to fully explain decisions -> Hard to isolate defect::

### Crashworthiness Doctrine
* Larsen vs GM: ::Auto-Manufacturer has duty to minimise injuries::

### Product liability
* Law may not apply if AVs deemed as service, not product
* Plaintiff shows:
	1. ::Defect::
		* ::Manufacturing Defect::  Departs from intended design during manufacturing even with care -> Strict liability
		* ::Design Defect::  Reduced or avoided by a reasonable alternative design (Cost-benefit analysis + state of art) -> Unclear Strict liability
		* ::Information Defect::  Could have been reduced or avoided by providing reasonable instructions or warning -> Unclear Strict liability
		* 	::Sellers liable is strict, in some states only liable if manufacturer is insolvent / outside jurisdiction::
	2. Defect actually & proximally cause
	3. Injury to P
	4. Defects made product unreasonably dangerous

*What are the different ways that reasonableness is mentioned in product liability?*

Why stricter liability and not negligence??
	* To increase incentive for safety,
	* Manufacturer in better pos to bear the cost
	* Asking courts to determine negligence in product manufacturer is too complex

Why not absolute liability?
	* Too expensive

### Alternatives
For:
	* ::Immunise AV manufacturers from liability since they are making safer driving::
	* ::Govt fund to pay victims, regardless of fault:: -> Funded by AV tax or general tax
	* ::No fault required, waive right to litigate, file claim w/o attorney::
	* Societal benefits > Harms
Against:
	* Fast, cheap non-adversarial but lacks transparency
	* Lack of updates like vaccines
	* Purpose of tort Sys
	* Market forces will determine
