## Timeline of AI
### 1950s Turing Test
* Alan Turing programmed the cryptanalytic machine to crack enigma
* The imitation game - Man & woman try to convince interpreter of their gender
* Computer tries to pass as human and human helps interpreter
* ::Turing’s prediction: Computer wins >30% of games after 5 mins by 2000 -> Hasn’t come true yet::
* ::Assumption that when prediction comes true -> “Machines Think”::

* /1956/ Dartmouth Workshop, John McCarthy coined AI
* /1968/ 2001 Space Odyssey: HAL
* /1969/ Shakey (Limited progress) -> No results so lack of funding

### 1970s - 80s AI Winter
* Congress cut military spending for pure research due to Vietnam
* ::Minsky’s Top down approach -> AI follow rules::
* Debate: “AI is a mirage” by showing Shakey

### 1981 Expert Systems
* ::Expert Systems: Follow if-then rules (replicate thought process)::
* System doesn’t Learn

### 1980 - 90s Bottom Up Theory
* *1986* ::Deep Learning Theory::: Artificial neurones which needs training data (Poor computer chips)
* *1990* Behaviour generating module -> Complex behaviours (Roomba)
	* ::Physical Interaction with environment::
* ::*1997* IBM Deep Blue vs Kasparov:: -> Brute Force *Top down Approach*
* *2002* iRobot Roomba + Packbot for Military
* *2010* Speech Recognition

### 2011 IBM Watson
* *2011* IBM Watson wins Jeopardy - NLP Interface

### 2013 DeepMind
* Seeking AGI
* One instruction - Improve score without explicit programming: Input is pixels
* *2013* DeepMind - Superhuman performance in 7 Atari games (Google 500m)

### AlphaGo
* *2016* AlphaGo beats Go champs
* ::Why a big deal? Games are an *objective benchmark of success*::

Google doesn’t think country should regulate AI
