## Amazon’s Hiring AI
* AI rates resumes 1-5
* For technical jobs, women downgraded (eg. words using women / woman colleges)
* Project was abandoned

* *Disparate Treatment* - Intentional discrimination
* *Disparate Impact* - Uses facially neutral criterion; Just need to prove discriminatory effect
::High risk of liability for *disparate impact*::

## FB Ad targeting
### Race discrimination
* FB doesn’t ask about race *but* determines ethnic affinity (cultural affinity not genetic) based on activity to target Ads (Employment, Housing etc.)
* ProPublica bought housing ads but couldn’t exclude caucasians
* Mobley vs FB (2016) *Fair housing and employment violation*
::FB agreed not to target based on ethnicity, religion and sexual orientation around the world.::

### Age discrimination
* *Why am I seeing this?* Feature showed age discrimination
* Class action lawsuits: plaintiffs (above 40) vs companies micro targeting for age. CWA vs T-Mobil (FB apparently added)
* Plaintiffs seeking back pay under ADEA and disparates.
::*ADEA - uncertain* as ad doesn’t state age only targets.:: 
::*Disparates - uncertain* as advertising is not same as hiring.::

*In Employment:*
* CRA64 refers to employment agency ::FB acts as an one -> Risk for liability::
*In Employment & Housing:*
* FB aids in targeting 
::FB compounds discrimination -> Risk for liability::

*CDA S230 (1996):* Protects Internet platforms from liability for user’s content
* Buyer buys FB obvious discriminatory ad but without FB micro targeting:
    ::Buyer Liable; FB not liable::
* Buyer micro targets but no obvious text:
    ::Buyer uncertain Liability; FB uncertain Liability::

* Outcome: FB removed targeting for job, housing and credit ads for age and sex
Theres a framework for deciding.
* Google and LinkedIn allows for exclusion on basis of gender/age 
* Some legal uncertainty while AI enables more targeting.

## Singapore
* Women on SGX boards earn 43% less
* Alliance for Fair Employment:
	1. MOM
	2. NTUC
	3. SG NEF

* If firm discriminates, MOM limits work pass privileges (Consequence only on Big firms)
* 10% of complaints on race and religion

* SG has ::no laws:: on corporate employment and discrimination
* ::“Promotional or educational approach to encourage employers”::
* SG has AI governance framework (::*Not legally binding*:: - will be amended)
* AI decisions should be ::explainable, transparent and fair and avoid intentional discrimination.::
* AI solutions be human centric
