* Processing is only lawful if consent given
	* For existing users -> Popups “Privacy policy has changed”
	* Consent to privacy policy or delete account
* Keep records to demonstrate compliance

## Consent
* Consent -> ::freely given, specific, informed & unambiguous given by statement or Affirmative action::
* ::Affirmative action:: 
	* ::Opt in - click to say consent::  -> IG ok
	* Out out - click to say you don’t consent (NOT)
* Silence, pre-ticked boxes and inactivity should not be consent
* Clear & plain language, easily understandable for average person -> IG not ok
* Needs separate opt-in for each purpose to give specific content
	* If consent is bundled up & non-negotiable -> Consent not given -> IG non-compliant
	
* ::Considerations for freely given consent:::
	* *Detriment* if you don’t consent -> IG non-compliant
	* *Imbalance of power* -> Maybe IG non-compliant
		* Dominant market position
	* *Conditionality of service* -> IG non-compliant 
		* Required to consent to more than necessary for IG to provide service
		* IG non-compliant as data for ad targeting not necessary to provide social network
	* 	*Granularity* -> IG non-compliant 
		* 	Doesn’t allow for separate consent to be given for different personal data processing options. IG has all or nothing.

* IG Fear: Consumers say they’ll use IG without personalised ads

### Sensitive Data
* Sensitive data such political / sexual views etc.
* Processing sensitive data is prohibited unless explicit permission given
* IG asks is bundled with all of its other consent
* IG needs to target u in specific ways -> Consent non granular

### IG defence
* Processing shall be lawful if at least one of the following applies:
	1. Subject has given consent for specific purposes  -> IG unlikely compliant 
	2. ::Processing is necessary for the performance of the contract:: -> Could save IG from liability
* State in the contract that users agree that processing is necessary
* FB states duty on ToS
* ::Privacy Policy says processing data is necessary to fulfil FB ToS or Insta Terms of use::
