### Warrants
* *4th Amendment* -  ::No unreasonable searches, warrants on probable cause & must describe place to search / people / things to be seized::
	* Police must go to ::neutral magistrate:: (Considers 4A Right)
	* ::Police sign affidavit detailing facts (*Probable cause* & Evidence)::

	* Establish the govt structure (Jud, Leg etc)
	* Constitution constrain what the govt can do
	* Writs of assistance (British Colony)
		* Authorise general searches
		* Transferable to loyalist & Long term

### Legitimate expectation of privacy
* Electronic Surveillance (Katz vs US)
	* Wiretapped public phone booth
	* Warrant Required due to expectation of privacy
	* 4A protects people not place
	* ::Need Warrant when there is a LEOP:: 
* 4A rights are often waived
	* Officer asks permission to search, person volunteers - OK
* LEOP requires:
	1. Actual EOP
	2. Objective EOP - reasonable to validate 1
* ::Person voluntarily consents, no need for officer to inform::
* ::In plain view from public place: No LEOP::
* ::In open fields: No LEOP::
* ::Non - US citizens who are not on US soil lack 4A rights::
* ::No warrant required during *emergency*::
	* Exigencies of situation
	* Probable cause
	* Insufficient time
* No LEOP for:
	* Airplanes flying over
	* Borders
	* Vehicles
	* Commercial property
	* Search body before arrest

### Warrant with Technology
* No SCOTUS rulings on biometric markers (Face, Gait, Iris etc.) & Drones
* Visual aids (Binoculars/Telescope etc) ::No warrant Required:: -> Common place tech that cops expect to have
* Judge granted warrant based on thermal imaging (2001) but thermal imaging not publicly available
* GPS attached to drug dealer car (28 days) -> ::Warrant required due to physical intrusion::
* ::Warrant req to search phone? (2014) -> Yes::
* 3rd party doctrine - ::if you voluntarily disclose to 3rd party (bank) -> No LEOP; no probable cause needed to get warrant but need relevance of info and get court order (Easier)::
* Monitor phone location data - *Exception* ::LEOP if only >7 days of data::
