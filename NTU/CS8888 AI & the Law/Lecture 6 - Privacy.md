## Predictive Policing
* Used by LAPD & top 20 biggest forces to generate periodic forecast
* ::Send officers to deter crime::
* Replace subjectivity with objectivity
* ::Input:::
	1. Years of crime data
	2. Location (Bar etc.)
	3. Time, Day etc.
	4. Weather
	5. Phase of the moon (crime increases during full moon)
* ::Stop & Frisk:: 
	* Search for weapons & immediately apparent contraband
	* Detention - not free to leave
	* Reasonable suspicion - Not a hunch but articulable; individualised suspicion particular to the person & regarding ongoing crime
* ::PredPol doesnâ€™t violate 4A - Police have discretion::
* ::Arrive stoping and frisking - if no individualised suspicion *YES VIOLATE*::
	
* ::Feedback loop::
	* Crimes found by officers increase - Usually minor crimes
	* ::*PredPol only uses crime reported by citizens (Major Crimes)*::

### Consequences	
* Reduce Crime? Researches - Yes; Independent Tests - No, not yet
* Lack of transparency due to private software (Not XAI)
* Art of policing has been eliminated

## Heat List

* ::Police warn them & offer social agencies help::
* ::Heat list effectiveness:: 
	* 2013 Rand Study - No for shooting but yes for shooters
	* Chicago Police - 70% of victims & 80% of shooters
