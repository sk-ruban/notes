# Characteristics of AI
* Less liquid
* More specialisation by investment managers.
* **Less regulation** and transparency.
* Less available historical return and volatility data. Different legal issues and tax treatments.
* Relatively **low correlations** with returns of traditional investments. High fees.
	- correlations may increase during market decline and disruptions
	- SD not a good measure as returns are often skewed + kurtosis (fat tails)
* Restrictions on redemptions
* ==Markets are inefficient -> Offer α returns==
* Fund Investing -> No expertise required, mgmt + incentive fees
* Co-Investing -> Follow fund's lead - Lack of control, lesser fees + ==Adverse Selection Bias (Asymmetric information)==
* Direct Investing -> Most control + no fees

# PE
## Leveraged Buyouts (LBOs)
* ==funded primarily by debt - bank debt, high yield bonds, mezzanine financing==
	- Low CP bonds
* Mezzanine financing - securities that have debt or preferred shares features and carry warrants or conversion features
* ==**management buy-outs** - existing management team involved==
* **management buy-ins** - external management team will replace
* high CF firms attractive for LBOs to pay back debt

## Development Capital 
* provision of capital for business growth

## Venture Capital
* invest in companies in the early stage and sold via and IPO
1) **Angel Investing**: Idea stage (usually individuals rather than VC funds)
2) **Seed Stage**:  For product dev, marketing and research (convertible preferred)
3) **Early Stage**: Initial production and sales
4) **Later Stage**: For expansion of product / sales (convertible preferred / debts)
5) **Mezzanine Stage**: capital to prepare firm for IPO 

* Committed Capital - amount an investor gives; usually drawn down over 3 to 5 years
* Management fees are 1-3% of committed capital
* Incentive fees are 20% of profits 
	- ==Clawback provisions - GP to return any funds distributed (to the GP) as incentive fees until the LPs have received their initial investments and the contracted portion of the total profits==
* ==Waterfall fees: American - Pay after each deal is completed==, benefits GP
* Trade Sale: selling to a competitor or strategic buyer
* Secondary Sale: selling to another portfolio company
* Recapitalisation: use debt to issue a dividend to PE firm
* low correlation - survivorship / backfill bias (self reported)

# Real Estate
* ==Potential inflation hedge== as rents and real estate values increase with inflation
* High correlations with EQ but less with bonds
* Residential property - MBS
* Commercial real estate - commercial MBS, REITS (counted if rented houses)
	- REITS: Income used to pay dividends
	- No tax @ REIT level if payout > 90%
* Timberland: Depends on Timber price + futures
* Farmland: Depends on commodity price

# RE Valuations
* **Appraisal Index**: Based on periodic estimates of property values
	- lowest SD (understate volatility)
* **Repeat Sales Index**: based on price changes for properties that have sold multiple times
	- must be representative of the property available
	- SELECTION BIAS
* **REIT Indices**: based on trading price of the REIT
	- ==Strong correlation with global equity==
	- Negative correlation with global bond returns
* **Comparable Sales Approach**: Value based on recent sales of similar properties
* **Income Approach**: calculates NPV of future CFs
* **Cost Approach**: estimates replacement cost of property

# Hedge Funds
* uses leverage + long short positions
* looks for α returns (**absolute** returns)
* trades through **prime brokers** - provides custodial service, money lending etc.
* less liquid
	- Lockup Period (No withdrawals allowed)
	- Notice Period (Time to fulfil request)
* performance NAV and redemption NAV

## HF Strategies
* Better than Global EQ in down markets but lag during up markets
* Some diversification benefits but correlations increase during financial crisis
* Valued at **bid price for long positions** and ask price for short positions

1) Event Driven
	- **Merger Arbitrage**: Buy acquire, sell acquirer
	- **Distressed / Restructuring**: Buy undervalued security
	- **Activist**: Influence company policy
	- **Special Situations**
2) Relative Value (Unusual pricing)
	- Convertible arbitrage FI: Exploit price difference btw convertible bonds and common stock
	- Asset Backed FI: Exploit pricing difference in ABS / MBS
3) Macro (Top down)
	- based on global macro trends
4) EQ HF (Bottom up)
	- ==Market neutral: Use technical and fundamental analysis to hold long and short EQ (Beta = 0)==
	- Growth: Use fundamental analysis to find high growth companies
	- Value: buy undervalued shares
	- Quant: Buy undervalued, short overvalued
	- Short Bias: Predominantly short positions in overvalued EQ

## Fees
* management + incentive fees (2, 20)
* hurdle rate - benchmark to pass before incentive
	- ==Soft: incentive fees paid on all profits, if passed==
	- ==Hard: incentive fees paid on returns over benchmark==
* catch-up clause: incentive on total / not just excess
* high watermark: incentive fee not paid on gains that offsets prior losses 
* FoF have additional (1, 10) fees
* ==Net means with (ie. deduct the management fees first)== 

# Commodities
* Lower returns than global stocks or bonds
* Low Sharpe ratios due to low returns + ==high volatility==
	- ==supply is inelastic== in the short run -> volatility
* Low correlations with global equities and bonds
* Commodity Prices tend to move with inflation rates - hedge inflation risk

## Commodity Valuation
* futures price ≈ spot price (1 + risk-free rate) + storage costs − convenience yield
* Futures price > Spot Price if there is no convenience yield -> Contango (+ Roll yield)
* High convenience yield -> Backwardation

# Infrastructure
* Brownfield: infrastructure that has been already constructed
	- Stable CFs and high yields but low growth
* Greenfield: Yet to be constructed
	- Relatively low yields but higher growth

# Risk Management
* Sharpe / SD is misleading as returns are not normal - leptokurtic (fatter tails)
* Sortino ratio - return relative to downside volatility
* Treynor ratio - excess return relative to Beta
* VaR - captures tail events 
* Operational, financial, counter-party and liquidity risk
* Returns should reflect a premium for liquidity risk

## Due Diligence
* Organization: Quality of management team
* Portfolio Management: Management of investment process
* Ops and controls: Reporting and accounting methods
* Risk Management: Fund policies and limits
* Legal Review: Fund legal structure
* Fund terms: Fees etc.
* reporting NAV is not adjusted for liquidity
