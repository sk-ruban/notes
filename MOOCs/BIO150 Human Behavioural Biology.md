* 2.3 IQ difference dependant in child order
    * Firstborns > Later-borns (Age 18)
    * Later-borns > Firstborns (Age 12)
    * Firstborns > Single Child
* Deer mice sperm can recognise sperm of the same mouse
* Rats prefer siblings through pheromones / MHC
* Oxytocin and vasopressin modify olfactory receptors to distinguish children
* Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb
* Mating with 3rd cousin is optimal
* Rat mothers will take care of baby mice from other mothers if switched straight after birth
* Baboon are polygamous 
    * Only give parental care when father baboon knows child is his
    * Same behaviour for sun fish males.
* New born babies can distinguish the mother's smell
* Humans usually don’t marry people who lived with them within the first 6 years of their lives

### Lecture 4 - Ethology
8 Jan 2019

* Wild rats have a thicker cortex
* Baby squirrels know how to eat a nut without being taught- Fixed action pattern
* Sloths don’t freak out at the visual cliff response
* Bees Movement
    * Axis of figure 8 wrt to sunlight shows direction of food
    * Longer - Further
    * Frantically - More exciting
* Tickle a rat on the ribcage and they giggle in an ultrasonic range, other rats will come to check it out.
* Females will have higher voices when ovulating, males are able to detect that subconsciously
* Baby monkeys prefer mothers who provide touch rather than food
* Female rats will give lordosis response when pressed in the back while ovulating

### Lecture 5 - Introduction to Neuroscience
9 Jan 2019

* Parts of the brain:
    1. Cerebellum - Controls motor movement and corrects mistakes to learn
    2. Frontal Lobe - Plans actions
    3. Parietal Lobe - Touch information
    4. Occipital Lobe -  Visual information
    5. Temporal Lobe - Auditory information & memory
    6. Limbic System = Hippocampus & amygdala
        * Hippocampus - Important to form memories 
        * Amygdala - Detects fear
    7. Hypothalamus - Fight / Flight / Feed / Fuck
* 90% of the cells in the brain are glia
* Average adult brain has ~ 100 Billion neurons
    * Quadrillion synapses > stars of milky way
* Dendrites -> Soma -> Axon hillock -> Axon -> Terminal
* Neuron off - Negative net charge
* Neuron on - Gets depolarised (must reach threshold) - Action Potential @ Axon Hillock
* Memory is in the synapse. Memory = Synaptic plasticity
* Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter
* LTP happens in the hippocampus
* Hunger & alcohol affects LTP
* Fast and slow throbbing carried on 2 different neurons
* Autonomic - Involuntarily(Heart beat, orgasm etc), unmylinated, slow, organs
* Sympathetic (EN) - Fight or Flight
* Parasympathetic (Acetyl choline) - Growth, Repair [They have opposite effects]
* Erectile dysfunction (Highly Parasympathetic) and premature ejaculation (Highly Sympathetic)
* Beta blockers block receptors, lowering heart rate (banned in Olympics)
* Centre of hypothalamus = centre of regulation -> spinal cord
* Limbic System - Mammalian (Emotions, etc)

### Lecture 6 - Endocrinology
16 Jan 2019

* Communication: 
	1. Cell to cell contact - 1:1
	2. Paracrine - 1:3
	3. Neuronal  - Fast electrical movement & specific
	4. Endocrine - Slow and big effect
* Peptide hormones - hydrophilic (insulin, vasopressin etc.)
    - Onset: Quick
    - Duration: Short
    - Cellular surface receptors 
* Steroid hormones - hydrophobic & bound to Chaperones
    - Onset: Slow
    - Duration: Long
    - Affects Transcription in DNA
    - Receptors in the cytoplasm
* Neurotransmitters can become hormones (Dopamine)
* Anterior & posterior pituitary (linked to hypothalamus) creates 2 different types of hormones
* Negative feedback important: Brain -> Pancreas -> Brain
* Hormones affect neurons

### Lecture 7 - Advanced Neurology and Endocrinology
18 Jan 2019

* Dale’s First law: Each neuron has its own single neurotransmitter [FALSE - can be up to 3]
* Different types of stressor hormones (EN, VP, CRH) can release ACTH - the secretion of ACTH is modified in quantity
* Dale’s Second Law: AP cause neurotransmitter to be released from every axion terminal [FALSE - can get blockades]
* Pre-synaptic auto-receptors to book keep and give feedback on neurotransmitter
* People don’t know how cells measure rates of change
* Pituitary has hormone producing cells in a mosaic
* Barbiturates make GABA more inhibitory - easier to perform surgery
* Progesterone also potentiates GABA receptors (PMS has lesser Progesterone) 
* GABA neurons can join with the axon of another neuron rather than a dendrite

### Lecture 8 - Limbic System
19 Jan 2019

* Reptilian Brain - Hypothalamus
* Ondine’s curse - cannot breathe automatically (death due to sleep deprivation) 
* Mammalian Brain - Limbic system
* Cortex decision making influenced by hormones (Limbic system)
* Limbic system influences hypothalamus
* White matter are cables surrounded by myelin
* Limbic System:
	1. Amygdala
	2. Hippocampus
	3. Septum
	4. Mammalliary body - maternal behaviour
	5. Thalamus
	6. Nucleus Accumbens - release dopamine (Cocaine works here)
	7. Ventral tegmental area
* Average social group in animal groups related to the pre-frontal cortex
* Move one finger = Move all fingers + Don’t move 4 fingers
* Amygdala gets bigger with PTSD
* Hippocampus gets smaller with depression
* Amygdala activates aggression
* Males return to baseline arousal quicker than women after sex

### Lecture 9 - Human Sexual Behaviour
19 Jan 2019

* Other female primates can orgasm
* Orgasm facilitates sperm movement, makes females tired and horizontal.
* HSB (Human Sexual Behaviour) affected by limbic system
* Medial pre-optic area (Performance) and amygdala (Motivation) affects HSB in males
* When males look at attractive women, dopamine activated.
* When males look away from ugly women, dopamine activated.
* Maybe (50%) increases dopamine more than certainty (normal distribution) = intermittent reinforcement
* Pictures of loved ones in short term relationship = dopamine activated
* Pictures of loved ones in 5 year relationship = comfort/empathy response.
* Progesterone / Oxytocin / Testosterone / Vasopressin produced after sex
* Spray oxytocin in the nose and humans become more cooperative in game theory
* Mutations in the vasopressin gene in autistic people
* Transgenders don’t have a phantom penis unlike 60% of amputated men
* Female perfumes use the sweat of male animals

### Lecture 10 - Human Sexual Behaviour
20 Jan 2019

* Women prefer the smell of men during ovulation
* Men prefer the smell of women during ovulation
* In rodents, smell of adult females delay puberty of younger females (not when siblings)
* Males accelerate puberty in females
* In rodents & primates, dominant males reduce the testosterone of lower ranking males
* Coolidge effect - Sexual responsiveness increases when females introduced
* Libido increases in ovulation but secondary increase also during Post-MS (No anxiety over pregnancy)
* Lap dancers get larger tips during ovulation.
* Estrogen (Ovulation) increases oxytocin, is sensitivity to progesterone, & sensitive to touch
* Residual sexual behaviour after castration is related to pre-castration sexual experience
* Melatonin triggers the onset of seasonal mating
* 300 species are recorded to be homosexual
* Testosterone converts to DHT and estrogen (inside target cells in brain)
* Estrogen has no effects in female foetuses
* If one is gay, identical twins have a 50% of being gay, non-identical - 22% covariance, siblings - 9% -> pre natal environment and genes decide sexuality
* Bonobo chimps have sex for non-reproductive reasons and have low aggression
* The more polygamous a species, the bigger the balls
* Female baboons mate with male baboons who are nice (Groom them, Not aggressive to them) -> Females have bigger body to compete for better male
* Low ranking orang-utans rape females
* Gay mens' sisters have higher than normal reproductive rate 
* Average faces look more attractive due to high symmetry
* Babies @ 2 months old prefer symmetry
* When women are ovulating, their faces become more symmetric
- Women have a preference for a longer forehead and a bigger jaw, more pronounced if the country is poorer
* Handicap principle: worse markers may be better
* Black maned lions more attractive.
* Baboons prefer females with higher swellings (More estrogen)
* High hips to waist ratio preferred because of western ideals
* Females with more attractive males produce bigger eggs (More effort put in by mothers)
* Popularity helps in sex for animals
* Homogamy - mating with someone similar to you
* Younger people have lesser homogamy
* In every culture, women want older/richer men. Men want healthy women. Both want nice people.

### Lecture 11 - Aggression I
22 Jan 2019

* Magnitude of violence is not wrong, just context of to whom and when
* Chimps make spears to attack
* Chimps patrol and coordinate attacks against other groups (genocide)
* Humans, rhesus, whales & dolphins are the few species that show reconciliation
* In baboons, only females reconcile
* Remove amygdala - no aggression, they don’t look at the eyes of people and more trustworthy
* Tumour in amygdala, creates high aggression
* Dopamine —> Frontal Cortex —> Limbic System —> “don’t do it!” reward system
* Shortcut to amygdala reduces accuracy 
* Williams syndrome kids are borderline retarded (IQ ~ 70) but have good language skills and very trustful
* Amygdala forms a “us vs them” dichotomy
* 25% on death-row have a higher prefrontal cortex damage from concussions/trauma (I.e less logic, inhibition, rational thinking)
* They know 'right and wrong' but are impulsed to do the wrong thing
* PFC is shut down during REM sleep
* Your PFC (logic center) is the last part of the brain to develop — maturing at ~25 yo
* Disinhibited grandmas/grandpas are really disinhibited because of having atrophied PFC —they can say whatever on their mind, and do things without caring
* Thrill seekers / sociopaths have lower PFC metabolism
* Socioeconomic disparities affects intelligence as stress raises stress-hormones which atrophies the PFC — leading to less executive, rational thinking
* People with PFC damage are much more utilitarian
* When told to hold a hot / cold cup, people interpret the personality as hot/cold
* Disgusting smells & tastes (olfactory/taste buds) activate the same part of the brain as feelings of moral disgust — insular cortex
* Humans make affective, limbic brain decisions before even processing logical prefrontal cortex
* Testosterone doesn’t change behaviour, just amplifies it

### Lecture 12 - Aggression II
28 Jan 2019

* Mirror neuron fires when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another
* Lower serotonin (stimulates PFC metabolism) -> more impulsive aggressive -> 5HIAA (found in urine) 
* MAO gene does not determine aggression alone: need environmental factors
* Alcohol, more aggression? No - merely magnifies pre-existing tendencies, including sedateness.
* In British / American colonised islands, drunk - aggressive, French colonised - more sex
* Fear sweat activates amygdala
* Aggression triggers:
	1. Pain
	2. Frustration
	3. Overcrowding
* Aggression is self-reinforcing
* Frustration displacement model (Soviet): 
	* Aggression goes down during famine in lions
* Behavioralists: Death penalties do not stop impulsive murder, but do reduce pre-meditated
* Sociopaths have excellent theory of mind
* Kohlberg's stages of moral development (Gender/ Cultural critic)
* People who believe : Ability > Effort -> Social Norm > Social Justice
* Male age predictive of violent (<25)
* Children pick up the accents of peer group not parents
* Absence of father not determining of violence, but neighbourhood is
* Unwanted kids are the highest crime risk.
* Rescuing someone - Implicit procedural learning (cerebellum) > Explicit declarative (hippocampus, cortex)

### Lecture 13 - Aggression III
30 Jan 2019

* Androgenised females have a higher than average IQ (due to higher IQ parents?), more often left handed, higher spatial skills -> ambiguous trends
* Autistic people have a more masculinised profile
* Nomadic pastoralists have more violence, warrior classes etc. -> Desert dwellers more violent 
* In Vietnam, breaking up of units was high -> breaking up kinship
* During Kuwait war, lies of killing children to justify war 
* Amygdala fires when you show a picture of another race -> Due to prompting
* People who grew up in multicultural places (Sustained exposure) didn’t have this effect.
* Critical in Game Theory :
	1. Repetition of interaction
	2. Multiple rounds of interactions
	3. Open book play (Reputation)
	4. Punishment

### Lecture 14 - Language
1 Feb 2019

* Deaf babies can babble in sign language
* There are accents / poetry / puns in ASL
* Language is a distinct module in the brain (William’s Disorder)
* 90% of people have language lateralised to the right
* Bronchus controls language production (Lips, Larynx etc.)
* Picturised languages (Chinese) use different parts of the brain
* Basal Ganglia controls motor movement
* Children are constructing their own rules / patterns for grammar by listening to parents
* At 3 months of age, babies show preference for real words
* By 9 months, they are losing ability to acquire phonemes of other languages
* If you learn a language after 12, you will have a accent
* Language created by the young are transferred chronically downwards
* When dogs are scared, they tug their tail between their legs to mask their pheromones
* All creoles have a similar grammatical structure -> Default grammar in humans?
* More ecological diversity -> more linguistic diversity
* In the next century, 90% of languages will go extinct -> Rarest language structures more likely to go extinct
* Click languages are probably the most ancient languages

### Lecture 15 - Schizophrenia
5 Feb 2019

* Prevalent in 1-2% of population
* Abnormal emotion, loose associations
* Trouble with abstraction (Real or metaphorical) -> Assume things more concretely / literally
* Delusions / Hallucinations (mostly auditory -  hearing Jesus / Satan in western countries)
* Social withdrawal
* There are many subtypes (Paranoid etc.)
* Extremely low rates of violence to others
* Half of them commit suicides
* Disease of adolescent onset (Highly unlikely to get above 30)

#### Neurochemistry
* Dopamine Hypothesis
	* Elevated dopamine waste products
	* Most schizophrenia medication block dopamine receptors
	* Dopamine exacerbates symptoms
	* L-Dopa -> Dopamine (Solves Parkinson’s but makes then psychotic)
	* Lowering dopamine will result in Parkinson’s
* Serotonin & glutamate increases also
* High metabolism during hallucinations
* Enlargement of brain ventricles and contraction of cortex
* Hypocampic neurons pointing the wrong way

#### Genetics
* 50% Heritability
* Abnormalities in MHC 
* Foetal environment - Foetuses during famines have higher schizophrenia

7 Feb 2019

* Early symptom for the Huntington’s disease is disinhibition -> disease of frontal cortex
* People with Huntington’s are sexually promiscuous (Onset is @ age 40)
* PANDA’s disease -> Due to immune system attacking brain
* OCD -> Increased metabolism in the Basal ganglia (Controlling movement)
* Jerusalem syndrome -> Alone / jet lag / religious - disappointed by city & starts tearing sheets; 50 cases / year
* Stendhal syndrome -> Florence; Sense of vertigo and nausea
* Rapunzel syndrome -> eating hair
